Over the weekend, I dedicated time to expanding my knowledge on Green AI and found various terms.For instance, "RED AI" and "GREEN AI." Then further digging through, I came across these two articles

- An artcile from 2023: [Generative AI’s Energy Problem Today Is Foundational]
- An artcile from 2020: [AI in the 2020s Must Get Greener—and Here’s How ]

## Extract of Statements 
- “In the race to produce faster and more-accurate AI models, environmental sustainability is often regarded as a second-class citizen.”
—Roberto Verdecchia, University of Florence
- “A single LLM interaction may consume as much power as leaving a low-brightness LED lightbulb on for one hour.”
—Alex de Vries, VU Amsterdam

## TakeWays
- reduce carbon footprint
- emphasize reproducibility
- optimize algorithm & hardware performance
- considering AI infrastructure with renewable energy sources
- partner more with starups, universities, entities to upskill talent 
- clear and straightforward monitoring and reporting on AI sustainability that is easy to understand and compare. utilize tools: [Green algorithm calculator]
- pragmatic scaling factor reductions
- Explainable AI (XAI)
- utilzie cloud based data centers, to reduce enerygy consumption and emission by 20-30%
