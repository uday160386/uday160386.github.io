Over the years I've seen some posters and online flyers and information about climate change, net zero and sustainability and never thought about thinking along these lines until I was confronted with some consequences.

As a responsible software engineer and environmental enthusiast, I would like to reflect on

###   I. The Impact of Technology

  A. Heat generated by electronic devices
  1. Personal laptops and mobile devices
  2. Office equipment such as computers, routers and Cloud environments

  B. Energy consumption and environmental impact
  1. Increased electricity usage
  2. Contribution to carbon emissions

  C. Controlling Carbon Intensity generated via Software
  1. capturing and measuring through metrics 
  2. practising and implementing the SCI specification wherever possible
  3. incorporating Carbon emission and intelligence as part of Non-functional requirements

### II. Consequences Faced
- Overheating and energy expenses
- Realization of personal contribution to environmental issues
