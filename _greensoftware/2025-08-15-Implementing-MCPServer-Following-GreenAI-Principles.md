The field of AI Engineering is rapidly evolving and expanding to explore new possibilities. This growth is marked by frequent updates to models, integrations, upgrades, and methodologies, occurring daily and monthly. These advancements are essential for keeping pace with the dynamic nature of AI technologies and their applications.

In the past few year, several key concepts have emerged in artificial intelligence. Agentic AI focuses on autonomous decision-making, while MCP (Model-Context Protocol) enhances model-context interaction. Explainable AI (XAI) prioritizes transparency in AI decisions, and multimodal AI integrates data from various sources. Additionally, there is an increasing emphasis on sustainable AI development, promoting environmentally friendly practices within the industry.

Given the buzz around the MCP Protocol, I want to share my insights as a Green AI practitioner on implementing sustainable AI practices in MCP server implementation. I will outline a few best practices and strategies that can enhance efficiency while minimizing environmental impact.
Before procedding futher, lets understand MCP and Green AI.
### What is MCP?
An MCP server, or Model Context Protocol server, acts as a bridge between AI models and external resources, enabling them to access and utilize tools, data, and other functionalities in a secure and standardized way. It essentially allows AI models to interact with the real world, going beyond simple text generation to perform actions and access information. 

### What is Green AI?
Green AI refers to an approach that aims to minimize the environmental impact of artificial intelligence systems across their entire lifecycle. This concept emphasizes the importance of standardizing measurements and metrics, which fosters transparency and builds confidence in AI technologies. By focusing on these aspects, Green AI encourages ongoing improvements in sustainability within the field of artificial intelligence.

To effectively implement Green AI, we need to focus on two key aspects: 

1. Embracing Green Software coding practices that prioritize sustainability.
2. Harnessing the power of eco-friendly Infrastructure, such as green cloud solutions.

By prioritizing these areas, we can drive innovation while minimizing our environmental impact!

### MCP Server file after implementing Green AI Coding standards


Here are code changes for optimizations to support Green AI in MCP server:
-   Adaptive Model Selection
    Dynamically choose smaller, faster models for non-critical tasks and only use large models when necessary.Uses smaller models for non-critical tasks (e.g., poetry).
-   Request Throttling
    Limit the rate of expensive API calls (e.g., weather) to avoid unnecessary energy and cost.Weather API calls are rate-limited per city to avoid unnecessary requests.
-   Idle Resource Cleanup
    Periodically clear caches and close unused resources to free memory. Caching size for PDF is configurable via the PDF_CACHE_SIZE environment variable.

-   Batch Processing
If multiple requests for weather or PDF extraction are expected, process them in batches.Use fetch_weather_batch to efficiently get weather for multiple cities in one call.
-   Energy/Carbon Reporting
Add a resource that estimates energy or carbon usage based on server metrics. The greenai://energy resource estimates server energy and carbon usage.

-   Environment-Aware Scheduling
Schedule heavy tasks for off-peak hours if possible. The heavy_task tool restricts heavy computations to off-peak hours for energy efficiency.

-   Periodic cache cleanup: 
The PDF cache is cleaned up based on a configurable timeout, freeing memory from idle resources.

-   Async I/O and lazy imports: 
Reduces blocking and memory usage for weather and PDF resources.

-   Logging: 
Resource usage and errors are logged for monitoring and future optimization.

## Harnessing the power of eco-friendly Infrastructure, such as green cloud solutions.

Cloud providers are actively promoting a “Green Cloud” approach, which focuses on using renewable energy to power infrastructure and services while optimizing for lower carbon footprints. These providers not only host systems in data centers that run on renewable resources, but they also offer customers tools and incentives to create more sustainable applications.

As an Azure Cloud practitioner, I will deploy the containerized MCP Server using Azure Container App.

Also, it's worth noting that Microsoft Azure is committed to sustainability, featuring carbon-neutral data centers, ambitious renewable energy goals, and tools to monitor and reduce carbon emissions.
####    All Azure VM Instances Are Green:

All Azure virtual machine instances benefit from Microsoft's carbon-neutral infrastructure and renewable energy commitments. This includes:

-   General Purpose VMs (A, B, D series)
-   Compute Optimized VMs (F series)
-   Memory Optimized VMs (E, M series)
-   Storage Optimized VMs (L series)
-   GPU VMs (N series)
-   High Performance Compute (H series)
-   ARM-based Azure Cobalt VMs - Utilize Microsoft's in-house designed ARM processors with Azure Cobalt VMs

####    Special Sustainable Regions
Arizona Region: The Arizona region is specifically mentioned as a sustainable datacenter <US West 3>region.


Now that, completed the deployment of MCP Server in US West 3 region and the server is accessible at <URL>

## Conclusion:

To integrate Green AI practices into your `green-mcp-server.py`, focus on energy efficiency and resource optimization with the following key actions:

1. **Efficient Model Usage**: Choose smaller models when high accuracy isn't critical, and consider model quantization or distillation.
   
   Examples of  Small Language Models (LLMs): 
   These are lighter than GPT-4/5 but still decent for text generation and reasoning.
   -    Mistral 7B – strong performance for its size, open source.
   -   LLaMA 2 7B / 13B – Meta’s models, widely used, good balance of size/quality.
  <br>
<img src="/images/posts/mcp_greenai/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf.png" style="width:600px;height:500px; border-radius: 15px;box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 5px #000000;">

   -   Gemma (2B, 7B) – Google’s small efficient models.
   -   Phi-3 (3.8B, 7B, 14B) – Microsoft’s “small but mighty” models optimized for reasoning.
   -   GPT-4o Mini – lightweight version of GPT-4o, designed for cheaper, faster inference.

1. **Resource Monitoring**: Log CPU, memory, and API usage. If possible, track energy consumption.
   
2. **Batch Processing**: Reduce API calls by batching requests to external services.
 ```
   import requests

    user_ids = [1, 2, 3]
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.example.com/users/batch",
        json={"ids": user_ids}   # send multiple IDs in one call
    )

    results = response.json()
    print(results)  # contains all 3 users’ data
    This way, you reduce 3 calls → 1 call.
   ```

1. **Caching**: Store frequent results (e.g., weather data) to minimize redundant computations.

2. **Responsible Data Handling**: Load only necessary parts of large files and limit the retention of large objects in memory.

3. **Transparency**: Set up a `/greenai/info` endpoint to report on energy use and green practices.


While I mentioned the MCP server, implementing these strategies will greatly enhance the sustainability of your AI applications.

Prioritising sustainable practices ensures that your AI initiatives are effective and ethically responsible, contributing to operational excellence and environmental stewardship.
