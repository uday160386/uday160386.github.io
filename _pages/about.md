With extensive global experience in the information technology sector, I have positioned myself as an Engineering Tech Lead, commencing my career at the age of 20. 

My professional expertise encompasses Backend engineering, mobile applications, digital banking, financial technology, payment systems, energy utilities, and product lifecycle management. 

Throughout my career, I have successfully contributed to enterprise-level initiatives, including digital transformations, foundational projects, technology migrations, software delivery, 
the adoption of modern technologies, and the development of cloud-enabled products for both business-to-business and business-to-consumer applications. 


I utilize this platform to share and publish technical stories focused on Green Software, AI in the Cloud, AI Apps epecially Speech Recognition, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
As an AI and machine learning enthusiast, I enjoy documenting my experiences and insights on my blog. Here, you'll discover notes and narratives about my work, the challenges I face, and the lessons I've learned, along with tips and tricks for navigating these technologies. 

I strive to make my content both informative and engaging, and I welcome your feedback and comments. I hope you find my posts enjoyable and valuable!
