An end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that accurately transcribes spoken language into written text across diverse domains and accents. The system is served via a FastAPI backend, presented through a Streamlit interface, and deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Key Concepts

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** — converting spoken audio into written text with high accuracy across varied accents and subject domains
- **Kaldi** — industry-standard open source toolkit for building speech recognition pipelines
- **Vosk API** — lightweight offline speech recognition library that wraps Kaldi models for easy integration
- **FastAPI** — high-performance Python web framework used to expose the ASR model as a REST API
- **Streamlit** — Python-based UI framework for building and serving the interactive front end
- **Azure AKS** — managed Kubernetes service used to deploy and scale the containerised application
