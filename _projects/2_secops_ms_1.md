## Introduction

Security Operations (SecOps) bridges the gap between software development and security monitoring by embedding security practices directly into the application lifecycle. For Spring Boot applications, a robust SecOps posture means integrating vulnerability scanning, runtime monitoring, secrets management, and threat detection — all achievable with open source tooling.

## Infrastructure & Platform

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Azure VM** | Azure-provided virtual machine where all tools and libraries are deployed |
| **Docker** | Containerization platform for packaging and running Spring Boot applications |
| **Kubernetes (K8s)** | Container orchestration tool for managing and scaling containerized workloads |

---

## CI/CD

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Jenkins** | CI/CD automation server for building, testing, and deploying pipelines |
| **Slack** | Messaging platform used to receive build and security alert notifications |

---

## Security Scanning & Testing

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **OWASP Dependency-Check** | Scans project dependencies for known CVE vulnerabilities |
| **SonarQube** | SAST-based continuous inspection tool for automated code quality and security reviews |
| **ZAP (OWASP ZAP)** | DAST-based penetration testing tool for detecting runtime vulnerabilities |
| **Trivy** | Lightweight open source scanner for container image vulnerabilities |
| **Gitleaks** | Detects secrets and credentials accidentally committed to source control |

---

## Kubernetes Security

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Kube-bench** | Checks if Kubernetes is deployed securely by running CIS benchmark checks |
| **KubeSec** | Identifies common exploitable risks in Kubernetes cluster configurations |
| **OPA Conftest** | Enables policy-as-code tests for Kubernetes manifests, Terraform, and Dockerfiles |
| **Falco** | Cloud native runtime security project for detecting unexpected application behaviour |
| **ISTIO** | Open source service mesh for securing, monitoring, and managing microservices communication |

---

## Observability & Monitoring

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Prometheus** | Monitoring system and time-series data store for collecting application metrics |
| **Grafana** | Multi-platform open source analytics and monitoring dashboard |
| **JaCoCo** | Java code coverage library for measuring test coverage |

---

## Summary

By layering these open source tools across the build, deploy, and runtime phases, you create a defense-in-depth SecOps posture for your Spring Boot application — catching vulnerabilities early, preventing misconfigurations, and maintaining visibility into security events in production.
